apiVersion: "bindplane.observiq.com/v1"

network:
  # The IP address the BindPlane server should listen on.
  # Defaults to "127.0.0.1".
  # Set to 0.0.0.0 to listen on all IP addresses.

  #host: "0.0.0.0"

  # The TCP port BindPlane should bind to. All communication
  # to the BindPlane server (http, graphql, web socket) will
  # use this port. Defaults to "3001".

  port: "3001"

  # The full http URL used for communication between client and server.
  # Defaults to "http://127.0.0.1:3001".
  # Set to the IP address of the server, this should never be "0.0.0.0".
  # Use "https" when TLS is enabled.

  # remoteURL: http://127.0.0.1:3001

  # TLS configuration for TLS and Mutual TLS.
  #
  # Enable client server TLS:
  #   set "tlsCert" and "tlsKey" on the server
  #   set "tlsCa" on the client or import the certificate authority into the operating systems certificate store.
  #   all agent's should trust the certificate authority (see your agents documentation).
  #
  # Enable client server mutual TLS:
  #  set "tlsCert", "tlsKey", "tlsCa" on the server and all clients.
  #  all agent's should be configured for mutual TLS (see your agents documentation).
  #  
  #
  # The path to the x509 PEM encoded certificate file.
  #tlsCert: /etc/bindplane/tls/bindplane.crt
  #
  # The path to the x509 PEM encoded private key file.
  #tlsKey: /etc/bindplane/tls/bindplane.key
  #
  # The path(s) to the x509 PEM encoded certificate authority files.
  # The server can be configured with multuple certificate authorities
  # when using mTLS, allowing the server to trust agents and clients with
  # different authorities.

  #- /etc/bindplane/tls/bindplane-ca.crt

auth:
  # Basic auth username. Defaults to "admin".
  # Uncomment and set to something secure.
